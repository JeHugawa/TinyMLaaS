    "However, in its current state the app can't be hosted on huggingface, because huggingface doesn't let the app access docker and the app must build docker images to compile the person_detection code, and upload them to Dockerhub for the relay to download. As a result the installing page doesn't work on huggingface. Because of this, the huggingface workflow is no longer set to run on pushes to the main branch, but you can enable it again by undoing the commit `2648ec6dd16ed4baeb3e4d97bd508a99132f7aed`."
